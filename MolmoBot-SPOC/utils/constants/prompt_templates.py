"""
Maps task type to a list of prompt groups.
Each prompt group contains a list of related prompt templates.
The purpose of prompt groups is to allow uniform sampling of prompts without sampling too many similar prompts.
So, you should uniformly sample a prompt group and then uniformly sample within the group.
